# Parallel-Dijkstras-Algorithm
Parallel implementation of Dijkstra's Algorithm

MPI program that parallelizes Dijkstraâ€™s. Input for the program consists of the number of vertices and adjacency matrix and the output of the program will be a list of lengths of the shortest paths from vertex 0 to all other vertices. Project from C and Parallel Computing class; Language: C.
